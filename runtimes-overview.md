# Runtime Complexity

- Constant Time (1) = with any given input, the algorithmic operation will always take a finite, unchanging amount of time
- Logarithmic Time (log(n)) = if you were to double the number of inputs, the number of outputs does not also double, but rather increases in a sloping manner
- Linear Time (n) = the time it takes to iterate through all of the elements with input, with a predictable increase in time for each increase in input
- Quasilinear Time (n * log(n)) = if you were to double the number of inputs, the number of outputs does not also double; not sure exactly what this means tbh
- Quadratic Time (n ^ 2) = every element is compared to every other element; nested for-loops
- Exponential Time (2 ^ n) = a single additional input causes the processing required to double
